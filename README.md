# Space Invaders

## Prompt: Recreate a videogame using Eclipse Workspace
After browsing a couple of simple games like Space Race, Tic-Tac-Toe, Snake, Crossy Road, etc. I decided to recreate Space Invaders in Java for my AP Computer Science A project. The game was simple enough that I could recreate the key concepts using the coding skills that I was taught earlier in the year, but difficult enough that I would have to come up with creative ways to solve problems - this would be a good game for my skill level. The program is completely finished, including barriers which I initially thought I would not have the time to add. 

### Running the game
The game is completely ready to be run using the Frame.java file after cloning this project.

### Controls
You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and is only able to move left and right, and tries to shoot every enemy and the UFO which appears on screen occasionally. However, once the spaceship you control is hit three times **you lose**.

Move left by using the "A" or left arrow key.

Move right by using the "D" or right arrow key.

Shoot the enemies using the space key.
